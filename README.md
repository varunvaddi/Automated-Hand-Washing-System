# Automated-Hand-Washing-System

By the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic, Hand-washing has become one of
the critical activities in preventing the spread of Infection. Frequent and proper hand-washing
with handwash is one of the most important measures that can be used to prevent the spread of
COVID-19. Hands are the main pathways of germ transmission during health care. W.H.O and
other health organizations recommend to cleanse the hands with the handwash for a minimum
of 20 seconds for the better and efficient Results.

This project is based on Automating and controlling the process of hand-washing. First
the IR sensors are installed near the handwash. These IR sensors are charged by step down
transformer, and then the bridge rectifier converts the AC current to DC current. The coding of
these programs is performed by Arduino software and then it is loaded into the microcontroller.
The timer is displayed on the LCD by the instructions loaded on microcontroller.

The main advantage of it is to increase the efficiency of the handwashing procedure by
controlling the Water supply. The future scope of this project to control the flow of handwash
and water for different scenarios like hospital staff, Sanitation Workers etc., based on Artificial
Intelligence. We can also make this hand-washing process more Interesting by playing some
music throughout the 20 second hand-washing procedure.
